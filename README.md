Bootcamp: UPENN-VIRT-DATA-PT-06-2023-U-LOLC-MTTH Module 14 Challenge

## Description
This project looks at the number and variety of bacteria present in belly buttons of various subjects.
In this study, the microbial species are referred to as operational taxonomic units (OTUs).

The resulting website provides a dashboard to access this data.
For a given study, it provides:

- a view of the participant demographic data
- a bar chart showing the top 10 OTUs present in the selected participant
- a gauge indicating the frequency of which the participant washes
- a bubble chart showing the size of the various bacteria cultures present

## Instructions
### Access the Dashboard

**This project uses web technologies and is deployed via github pages to <https://4a6166.github.io/belly-button-challenge/>.**

It pulls data on each update from a project on [The Public Science Lab](http://robdunnlab.com), so it requires an active internet connection to update.

### Dependencies
The project uses [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/) and [D3](https://d3js.org) for data gathering, manipulation, and presentation.

It uses [Bootstrap 3.3.7](https://getbootstrap.com) for website styling.
